## Run instructions
1. Run `docker-compose up`
2. Please wait until all services running

## Test Case Scenario
1. Create product `POST /products`
2. Register customer `POST /customers`
3. Create order `POST /orders`, order status is `placed`, event `ORDER_PLACED` is sent
4. `ORDER_PLACED` is consumed by `inventory-service`, if inventory is enough or product is exist, event `ORDER_CREATED` is sent, otherwise `ORDER_REJECTED`. Stock and sold are updated accordingly.
5. `ORDER_CREATED` is consumed by `order-service`, status and total price is updated
